# Kotlin Multiplatform Migration
Most files are copied from [wowsinfo-core](https://github.com/wowsinfo/wowsinfo-core) directly and modified for this sample project. See [#3](https://github.com/wowsinfo/wowsinfo-core/issues/3) for more information.

This approach can still be risky especially when it requires modifications to ktor directly to support Apple platforms. Please use this approach with caution.
